# `Procfile` extension for Visual Studio Code

A [Visual Studio Code][vscode] [extension][vscext] with support for
[`Procfile`s][heroku].

![syntax hilighting](https://github.com/benspaulding/vscode-procfile/raw/main/assets/side-by-side.png)

The `Procfile` is mostly known for its use by [Heroku][] and [Foreman][]. However, it
is supported by a number of other services and utilities, and is extremely handy for
development. With this `.env` file:

```dotenv
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_site.settings.local
WEB_HOST=0.0.0.0:8000
BROWSERSYNC_PORT=9000
```

… and this `Procfile`:

```procfile
# Run the Django Web app.
django: django-admin runserver "$WEB_HOST"

# Monitor and rebuild all static/front-end assets.
assets: npm run watch

# Run Browser Sync proxied to the Django Web app.
djsync: browser-sync start --proxy="$WEB_HOST" --port="$BROWSERSYNC_PORT"
```

You can run `honcho start` and have it all up and running!

## Features

This extension is _packed_ with features, especially for one that you will hardly
ever have to use! However, I believe both you and the humble `Procfile` deserve only
the best. :)

### Syntax Highlighting

As seen above, the files are highlighted not only to show what a valid process
definition is, but it also highlights the command to run using the shell highlighter.

### Service-Specific Information

Some services, such as Heroku, give special meaning to certain process names.
Hovering over those will now give a description and a link to documentation.

### Formatting

Having whitespace between the process name and the command is optional. This
extension exposes an `insertSpace` (default: `true`) setting to its formatters. All
three types of formatting are provided: on-type, selection, and complete document.

### Diagnostics

A `Procfile` must have unique process names. The extension provides feedback when a
name has been duplicated.

### Symbol Navigation

You have probably never seen a long `Procfile`, but just in case you do, this
extension has you covered! You can navigate through the processes with the
breadcrumbs or the command palette.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/benspaulding/vscode-procfile/blob/main/./CHANGELOG.md).

## Todo

There are still a few things I plan to do.

### Cleanup

- Write tests:
  - core
  - diagnostics
  - formatters
  - hovers
  - symbols
- Clean up core modules (reconsider the Line/Text setup)
- Consider releasing core module as own procfile package

### Features

- Add automatic tasks ([t1], [t2]) for running Procfiles.

## `Procfile` runners: Foreman & Clones

The most used and robust are:

- [Foreman][] (Ruby)
- [Honcho][] (Python)
- [Goreman][] (Go)

Others include:

- [node-foreman][noreman] (Node) _— n.b. How on earth is this not named “Noreman”?
  I insist on referring to it as such!_
- [Shoreman][] (Shell)
- [forego][] (Go)

There is no published standard for `Procfile` syntax, but Foreman can be used as the
reference implementation. Though the various runners recognize different things as
comments, process, or errors, Foreman’s syntax is recognized by this extension.
